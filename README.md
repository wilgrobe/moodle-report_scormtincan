# moodle-report_scormtincan

This project allows scorm event records to be reported to an outside LMS. It was loosely based on a 
similar project wilgrobe/moodle-report_tincan that hopefully will eventually be merged into the 
project it was forked from garemoko/moodle-report_tincan. This project probably should not be merged
into garemoko/moodle-report_tincan, as that is to allow tincan reporting of quiz events, and this
is to allow reporting of scorm course events.

Having said that, both of these require additions to the base moodle code, particularly in the addition
of specific events and triggers. That code is located at wilgrobe/moodle and hopefully, will eventually
find it's way into production moodle code.
